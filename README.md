## My Journey
I hold a degree in Advertising and Marketing, a postgraduate degree in Business Management, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science.

This background has given me a unique perspective and taught me to approach problems holistically, combining creativity, technical analysis, strategy, and business vision.

I worked for several years in design and strategic management, an experience that taught me how to bring innovation and technology into businesses.

I also worked as a day trader, using statistics and programming (Mql5) to develop and test trading robots. This experience strengthened my ability to analyze data in high-pressure scenarios.

Now, my mission is to combine my multidisciplinary background with my passion for data, AI, and computer science to create solutions that make a real-world impact.

## What Drives Me
- Using data to improve education, healthcare, and social policies
- Participating in impactful global projects
- Growing as a professional in Data Science and Machine Learning while contributing to a more equitable future
